#Behaviour-Driven Developments
This is an Agile software development methodology in which this website is documented and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it. The following are some of the scenarios that one may expect to encounter when using the website depending on the input:
##Scenario 1: Successful Login
Given the user is on the login page,
And the user has entered their correct birthday date.
And clicks the "Login" button,
On submission, the application displays the user's Akan name correctly based on their gender.
##Scenario 2: Login with Nonexistent Username
Given the user is on the login page,
And the user enters a birthday date that does not exist in the system,
And clicks the "Login" button,
Then an error message is displayed saying, "Invalid birthday date"
And the user remains on the login page.
##Scenario 3: Login with Incorrect birthday date
Given the user is on the login page,
And the user has an incorrect birthday date,
And clicks the "Login" button,
Then an error message is displayed saying, "Invalid birthday date"
And the user remains on the login page.
